# write a specification for an MCP (model context protocol) server for holding memories.

Behind the scenes it will create a temporarly aware knowledge graph of facts, snippets of memory, instructions, discussions, conclusions from it's own aggragating functions.

On the front end it will have very limited interfaces such as:

What do I remember about (x) - returns specific memories
I should remember (x) for the future (optionsally:, it is in the context of (y - might be a project or a topic or a location or a period or any meta data)
What do I know about (x) - returns highlights, snippets about x with ID pointers for more detail
Recall memory (ID pointer) - to get full details of memory including meta data and pointers to related memory (related by time, project, innetnt etc)

Behigh the scenes a low priority "dreamer" will gather random memories compare them for any connection (using an AI) and if not connected abondon tehm but if by chance are connected the build a meta link between memories with a weighting of how related).  this table of meta links will help the recall functions find "related" items.

The dreamer mode will also notice when there is a tight cluster of x items that all have meta links of quite high strength and then will synthesize a summary or abstract node that will be inerted into the memory graph with strong links to its originating components.

These summary nodes are like any other node and may be surfaced by queries or by the dreamer when doing conslidation.

In fact summary nodes, particularly if they are summaries including other summaries so they have high summation value, which be prioritized when the front end asks "what do I know about (x)" as a summary node will be a good starting to point to know an overal feel.

Temporal awareness - as nodes get older they are low priority UNLESS they have been accessed recently.  So it is more "most recentlly accseed" that is important, not including random dreamer access, but eal access from the front end is "recall" and causes there to be a boost to that node.

Nodes that are never accessed gradually get to a lowest level of priority and potentially could be pruned away though for now keep them so they can still be found be extensive searching ("I'm sure I know about x, lets try harder to remember anything about x" which returns a list of titles of thememory nodes to the ai which may they choose to retrieve it by ID.

Flesh this out, see what I'm doing here, prepare a specification.  This will be an MCP server that works either locally (stdin/out) or via http (sse), with some sort of basic authentication (key value in a header x-memory-key or as a ?key= in the url for remote).

Certainly! Here's a detailed specification for an **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server** designed to hold, manage, and retrieve memories with the behaviors and features you outlined.

# MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server Specification for Memory Management

### Overview

The MCP server is a memory-oriented knowledge graph management system that stores facts, memories, instructions, discussions, and conclusions. It dynamically creates and manages a temporally aware knowledge graph that can be queried and extended by clients. The server supports a minimalist, intuitive front-end query set with a background "dreamer" process that enhances and abstracts connections within memories over time.

***

## 1. Functional Requirements

### 1.1 Memory Storage and Representation

- **Memory Nodes:** The fundamental unit of storage, representing facts, snippets, instructions, conclusions, discussions, etc.
- **Metadata:** Each memory node contains:
    - Unique ID (UUID or similar)
    - Content payload (free text or structured data)
    - Creation timestamp
    - Last accessed timestamp
    - Optional associated context metadata (project, topic, location, time period, other tags)
- **Memory Types:** Normal nodes, summary/abstract nodes


### 1.2 Knowledge Graph

- Stores directed, weighted links (edges) between memory nodes representing relationships such as:
    - Temporal proximity
    - Contextual similarity (project, topic, location)
    - Intent or semantic relatedness (AI-generated)
- Edge weights represent strength of the relationship (float value, e.g., 0.0 to 1.0)

***

## 2. Front-End Interface (Client API)

The MCP server exposes a limited set of concise commands to access and augment the memory graph.

### 2.1 Commands

#### 2.1.1 `What do I remember about (x)?`

- Input: Query string `x` (keyword, phrase, or concept)
- Output: List of memory nodes directly matching or referencing `x`
    - Includes memory ID, summary or snippet, and relevant metadata
- Purpose: Retrieve specific memories linked explicitly or implicitly to `x`


#### 2.1.2 `I should remember (x) for the future [context: (y)]`

- Input: Memory content `x`; optional context metadata `y` (project, topic, location, period, etc.)
- Action: Create a new memory node, store in the graph
- Returns: New memory node ID, confirmation
- Purpose: Add or update memory with context for future recall


#### 2.1.3 `What do I know about (x)?`

- Input: Query string `x`
- Output: Summary/highlights about `x`
    - Return higher priority nodes, especially summary nodes and clusters relevant to `x`
    - Response includes snippet, node ID, and metadata
- Purpose: Get a high-level overview or insight of `x` with pointers to deeper memories


#### 2.1.4 `Recall memory (ID)`

- Input: Memory unique ID
- Output: Full details of the memory node, including:
    - Full content
    - Metadata (timestamps, context tags)
    - Links to related memory nodes (by time, project, intent...)
        - Related nodes with their IDs and relation weights
- Purpose: Retrieve full memory detail, useful for follow-up processing or display

***

## 3. Background Processes

### 3.1 Dreamer Mode (Background AI Worker)

- Runs asynchronously with low priority in idle/background periods.
- Responsibilities:
    - **Memory Link Discovery:** Randomly sample memory nodes, apply AI/semantic analysis to find connections.
        - If connections are significant, create or strengthen meta links.
        - Otherwise, abandon extracted relationships.
    - **Meta Link Table:** Maintains and updates weighted relationship edges between memories.
    - **Summary Synthesis:** When clusters of nodes show strong interconnections, synthesize a new summary/abstract node.
        - The summary node links strongly to all its source nodes.
        - Summary nodes can aggregate other summaries recursively.
        - These nodes add hierarchical structure and aid in efficient high-level cognition.
    - **Consolidation:** Periodically consolidates knowledge graph for coherence and pruning hints.


### 3.2 Temporal Awareness and Node Prioritization

- Nodes have priority scores, influenced by:
    - **Recency of Front-End Access:** Each explicit recall from the front-end HIP (human interface protocol) interaction updates last accessed timestamp and boosts node priority.
    - **Age:** Older nodes decay in priority over time unless recently accessed.
    - **Dreamer Access:** Does NOT influence priority.
- **Pruning Considerations:**
    - Nodes never accessed from front-end can drop to a low priority.
    - No immediate pruning; but these nodes can still be searched for with exhaustive queries.
- **Exhaustive Search:**
    - If client expresses uncertainty, server can deepen search and return extensive lists of possible relevant nodes for manual or AI-driven retrieval.

## 4. Data Model

| Field | Type | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `id` | UUID | Unique node identifier |
| `content` | Text/JSON | Memory content |
| `created_at` | Timestamp | Creation date/time |
| `last_accessed_at` | Timestamp | Last explicit front-end recall |
| `context` | JSON | Optional context metadata tags |
| `type` | Enum | `normal` or `summary` |

**Relations:**


| Relation | From Node ID | To Node ID | Weight (0.0-1.0) | Type (optional) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| e.g., "related_to" | UUID | UUID | Float | Semantic/Temporal/Project/Intent |


***

## 5. API Specification

### 5.1 Transport

- Support for:
    - Local mode: stdin/stdout interactions (CLI or embedded system)
    - Remote mode: HTTP with server-sent events (SSE) for real-time updates or streaming responses


### 5.2 Authentication

- Basic key-value authentication
    - Request Header: `x-memory-key: <key>`
    - Or URL query parameter: `?key=<key>`
- Key verified against server config


### 5.3 Request/Response Format

- JSON request and response payloads
- Structured commands with clear fields, e.g.:

```json
{
  "command": "remember",
  "content": "Met with Alice about project X",
  "context": {
    "project": "X",
    "location": "Office",
    "period": "2025-Q3"
  }
}
```

- Responses include status, IDs, content snippets, metadata.

***

## 6. Sample Workflows

### Adding a Memory

Client:
`I should remember "Meeting notes with Alice on project X" with context (project: "X", location: "Office")`

Server:

- Creates a memory node with content and context
- Returns new memory ID


### Querying Specific Memories

Client:
`What do I remember about "Alice"?`

Server:

- Searches nodes mentioning "Alice"
- Returns matched memory snippets and IDs


### Querying Summaries

Client:
`What do I know about "project X"?`

Server:

- Returns summary nodes or cluster highlights with links


### Recall Memory by ID

Client:
`Recall memory 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000`

Server:

- Returns full memory detail, metadata, and related nodes

***

## 7. Implementation Notes

- Use a graph database or embedded graph store (e.g., Neo4j, TigerGraph, or a custom in-memory graph).
- AI connections may use embeddings + vector similarity or advanced semantic search.
- Dreamer runs on a low priority background thread/process.
- Support persistence and reloading of memory graph state.

***

# Summary

The MCP Memory Server combines simple intuitive front-end commands around querying and storing memories in a rich, AI-augmented knowledge graph with a background "dreamer" function that dynamically discovers and synthesizes relationships and summaries. Temporal awareness, priority decay, and user-focused access patterns shape memory relevance and persistence, providing a scalable yet intelligent scaffold for model-context aware personal or organizational memory recall.
